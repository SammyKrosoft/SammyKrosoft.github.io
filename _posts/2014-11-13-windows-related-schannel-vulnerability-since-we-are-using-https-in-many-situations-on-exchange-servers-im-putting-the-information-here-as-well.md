<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="3">The security update MS014-066 was released last Tuesday with the normal patch Tuesday releases and very little mention was made of it.</font></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p><font size="3"></font></p><p><font size="3">It addresses a vulnerability in Microsoft&rsquo;s implementation of Secure Channel (SChannel) that is used to establish SSL connections.&nbsp; If this vulnerability is exploited an attacker could run code remotely on servers and/or workstations that use the current SChannel algorithms. It can affect servers and clients as well, and the impact is the ability for remote code execution rather than just communication interception.</font></p><p><font size="3"></font></p><p><font size="3">The good news is that the patch is available.&nbsp; We highly recommend testing the patch and deploy it once tested as soon as possible.</font></p><p><font size="3"></font></p><p><font size="3">So again, the patch is available and should be implemented as soon as possible.&nbsp; The bad guys are already hard at work trying to reverse-engineer the patch (just as a comparison point, they only took 12 hours to figure-out and exploit Heartbleed)&hellip;</font></p><p><font size="3"></font></p><p><font size="3"><em>More information is available here:</em></font></p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS14-066"><font size="3">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS14-066</font></a></p><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/11/potentially-catastrophic-bug-bites-all-versions-of-windows-patch-now/"><font size="3">http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/11/potentially-catastrophic-bug-bites-all-versions-of-windows-patch-now/</font></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="3"><strong><u>Pasting the FAQ from the TechNet link above for quick reference:</u></strong></font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong>       <br>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a target server.</font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong>       <br>An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to a Windows server.</font></p><p><font size="3"><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong>       <br>Server and workstation systems that are running an affected version of Schannel are primarily at risk.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u><font size="3"><em>Many thanks to Mike MacGillivray for putting together all the above information !</em></font></u></strong></p></p>
