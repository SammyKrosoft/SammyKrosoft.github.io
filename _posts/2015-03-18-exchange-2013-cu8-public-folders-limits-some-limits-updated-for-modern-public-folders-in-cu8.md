When you are migrating from legacy versions of Exchange 2007/2010 to Exchange 2013 CU8 we now support migrating up to 500,000 public folders, a 200% increase from CU7. After your migration to Exchange 2013 CU8 has completed, or you are starting in a greenfield deployment of Exchange 2013 CU8, we now support up to 1,000,000 public folders, a 400% increase from CU7. The number of supported public folder mailboxes remains at 100 for the time being. In addition no single public folder mailbox in the organization may contain more than 100,000 public folders. The 100,000 value includes both active and deleted public folders stored within the public folder mailbox that have not yet aged out of the system due to your configured deleted public folder retention settings. Please remember that on-premises public folder scale limits are not the same as those used in Exchange Online. Exchange Online limits can be found at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx">this article</a>, and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn594582(v=exchg.150).aspx">this documentation</a> will be updated in the near future to reflect Exchange 2013 CU8 on-premises’ new limits.</i><i></i></p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn594582(v=exchg.150).aspx">Updated limits on the TechNet Limits for Public Folders article</a></li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Reminders/Links:</span></b></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46373">Cumulative Update 8 for Exchange Server 2013 (KB3030080)</a></b></li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li><b><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2015/03/17/announcing-cumulative-update-8-for-exchange-server-2013.aspx">Some notes from the Exchange Product Group Team as well</a>:</b></li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>The above article highlights some new improvements :</p> </blockquote>  <ul>   <ul>     <li>Calendar and Contact Modern Public Folders favorites added in Outlook are now accessible in OWA</li>      <li>Batch Migration of Public Folders to 2013 improves migration throughput and PF migration experience</li>      <li>Smoother migration for EAS clients to O365 with automatic profile redirect upon successful Hybrid migration to O365 (EAS client must support HTTP 451 redirect)</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <ul>   <li><b>Other notes :</b></li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>- Upgrading from Cumulative Update 7 to Cumulative Update 8 does not include Active Directory schema updates(see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb738144%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx#ClassesModCU8">Exchange 2013 Active Directory schema changes</a> and <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb125224%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx#Verify">Prepare Active Directory and domains</a> articles confirming this)</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p>- Thanks to <i><a>Hans Moser (Swiss MS PFE)</a></i> for the below confirmation through testing as well:</p> </blockquote>  <blockquote>   <p><i>The versions are still the same like in CU7, so there was no change.        <br />SchemaVersion=&quot;15312&quot;         <br />OrganizationVersion=&quot;15965&quot;         <br />DomainVersion=&quot;13236&quot;</i></p> </blockquote>  <p><b></b></p>  <ul>   <li><b>And finally as a reminder:</b></li> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>- </strong>Exchange 2013 CUs are full bits of the Exchange product, so you can directly install Exchange from scratch (for new environments or new servers) using the above mentioned CU8 download, as well as apply the CU8 just like an “old school” service pack or patch, using your regular update procedures.</p> </blockquote>  <p></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p></p>  <ul></ul>
