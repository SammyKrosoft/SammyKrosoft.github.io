<p>&nbsp;<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t yet deployed Exchange 2010, our recommendation is to avoid /hosting mode and go directly to Exchange 2010 SP2 using the on-premises configuration. This will allow you to offer the features customers are looking for, and avoid a cross forest migration down the road.&rdquo;</p><p><a title="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2011/10/13/future-of-hosting-mode.aspx" href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2011/10/13/future-of-hosting-mode.aspx"><em>Source : </em></a></p><p><strong><em>Future of /Hosting Mode</em></strong></p><p><em>http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2011/10/13/future-of-hosting-mode.aspx</em></p></p>
