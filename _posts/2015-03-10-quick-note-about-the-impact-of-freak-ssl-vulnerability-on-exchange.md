<span style="font-size: small">Hi <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">all</span>,</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: small">Here is a note about the impact of <span style="color: black">FREAK (</span><span>Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Key - CVE-2015-0204) <span style="color: black">vulnerability on Exchange (<span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif"><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3046015">Microsoft <span>Security Advisory 3046015 - <i>Vulnerability in Schannel Could Allow Security Feature Bypass</i></span></a></span>)</span></span><span><span style="color: black">
</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small"><span><span style="color: black">As a reminder, this vulnerability is not specific to Windows OS, it's a general SChannel vulnerability that could allow an attacker to force the downgrading of the cipher suites used in an <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/dn848375.aspx#SSL">SSL</a>/<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/dn848375.aspx#TLS">TLS</a> connection on a Windows client system. In other words, this enables the switch of cipher algorithm from a strong one to a weaker one using RSA key exchange export, and the hacker can then intercept and decode the SSL traffic.</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small"><span><span style="color: black">
</span></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><span style="color: black">This vulnerability is not Exchange specific but OS specific, and since the security of Exchange relies heavily upon the security of its dependencies like the OS, anything that impacts the security of the OS that Exchange is in impacts also Exchange. That's why you won't see any Exchange specific guidance on this.

<span style="font-size: small"><span style="color: black"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>UPDATE </strong>==&gt; See the link to the fix above – prior to that the guidance was to follow the mitigation actions described in the above mentioned article (<span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3046015"><span>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3046015)</span></a>, which was to disable the RSA key exchange ciphers on the SSL configuration settings using GPOs - note that this workaround works on Windows Vista and later – now we have a fix !</span></span></span></span><span style="font-size: small"><span><span style="color: black">
