<p>&nbsp;<p><u>Installing ExMerge:</u></p><p>ExMerge download link :</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2743">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2743</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Installing ESM 2003 on a Windows 7 64 bits machine:</u></p><p>- First download the ESM for Vista :</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17836">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17836</a></p><p>- Second, extract the MSI (launch the .exe) somewhere</p><p>- Third, run <strong>ESMVISTA.MSI /passive</strong></p><p>Of course an ESM 2003 on a Windows 7 is not supported, but that only means &ldquo;not tested&rdquo;, that actually works&hellip; now we have to test using ExMerge with this from a Windows 7 64 bits.</p><p>Well it&rsquo;s just for one export right? Then we just have to make it work. But you won&rsquo;t get any help if it doesn&rsquo;t work or if it crashes !</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note: For a more long-term SUPPORTED solution, we&rsquo;ll have to install Exchange 2007 management tools on a 32 bits machine.</em></p></p>
